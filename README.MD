Welcome to my first multilanguage project!

My first task is to make an interactable program to calculate the amount of factors of a number with only using built-in modules or libraries.

Self-imposed rules:
- No external libraries or modules 
    - Built-in modules such as Python's math or built-in modules such as C's 'stdio.h' are acceptable
    - Modules requiring package installers such as pip to function such as Python's requests are not allowed.
- For the JS portion, the interactable program is in a webpage.
